Introduction.
This page displays some basic information about a self-modifying Perl file. To do this, it uses the page's URL (so that it can get its source verbatim) and the body's original HTML content (in
case its self-retrieval fails) to parse out the Perl object's state. Unfortunately it isn't possible to run Perl from inside Javascript yet. Otherwise the UI would show the runtime state of
the object as well as its static state.
