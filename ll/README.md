# Low-level objects

These encapsulate various parts of the self-modifying logic and are suitable for building self-modifying
scripts that contain no shell. These scripts do not have friendly interfaces and generally must be edited
by using the 'perl' command.

If you want a script that works, I recommend using [object](../object).
